Tutorial   3
Practical applications of valuing   equity.   A case   study   of   FerrariYou are a   buy-side analyst who   works   for   a   large   asset   management   firm.   Your   head   of      investments   has   requested you   prepare a valuation of   Ferrari. Your firm   is   interested   in   purchasing a significant stake   in   Ferrari   but only   at the   right   price.
This   is a   real case designed to demonstrate   the   valuation   challenges   faced   by   asset managers. Your task   is to   read through the case and   identify   and   extract   relevant   data.   I   have also   uploaded a spreadsheet with the   financial   data.
Hint: this case does   not   require a   lot   of calculations.   This   case   is   mainly   about   identifying   and   interpreting data   relevant to equity valuation.
Read the   Harvard case and come   prepared to the tutorial to discuss   the   following:

2.       What   is   Ferrari’s current financial   strategy? Why   does   Ferrari   take   part   in   an   IPO?
3.       Using a   multiples   approach,   place   a   value   on   Ferrari   shares.   You   decide   what
multiple to   use to arrive at a valuation. Justify   your   approach   as   much   as   you   can.
4.       Your firm’s   brokerage   has supplied a   valuation   of   Ferrari   using   free   flows   (shown   in      Exhibit TN 3   [pg.   10] of the case).   How   does this   valuation   approach   work?   Be   ready   to answer questions from your   investment team about   assumptions   made   and   how   sensitive the valuation   is to changes   in these assumptions.
5.       At what   price do you   recommend   your   firm   would   be   buyer   of   Ferrari   shares?
